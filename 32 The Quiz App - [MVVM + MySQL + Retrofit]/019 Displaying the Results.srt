1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,490
When the user finishes the quiz, we need to direct him when he clicks on the finish button to the results

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,060
activity.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,000
In this video, we'll create this results activity.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,450
Open comm Cadinot the quiz app.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:22,820
And here I'll create a new activity empty views activity and I'll name it as results Activity.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,720
Click finish.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,910
Let's go to the layout file.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,659
Go to split mode and in this activity I'll include two text views and one.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,720
But of course I'll create a drawable.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,220
So I'll copy this gradient back and name it as back to.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,850
And I'll change these colors to these colors.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:51,380
Go back to the activity results and I'll use the background and drawable gradient to okay.

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,750
As I told you, this activity will contain two text views and one button.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,970
And by the way this will use the layout tag because I'm using data binding.

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,690
So.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,190
Inside this constraint layout, I'll start creating the text views and the button.

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,990
And congratulations, we created our layout.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,020
It's very simple.

19
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,240
Two text views and one button.

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,370
Now let's move to the results activity.

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,580
Inside it I'll create the binding activity result binding binding.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:10,840
And here I'll use binding equals to data binding util dot Setcontentview.

23
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:21,370
This dot layout dot activity results I'm using this data binding and binding dot text answer dot set

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,090
text.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,150
Your score is.

26
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm going to get the score from the main activity dot result variable which is the static the total

27
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,840
number of questions.

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,980
So the result is five answers over ten questions.

29
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,240
So five over ten.

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,590
This is the algorithm.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,310
We have two variables the result and the total question.

32
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,640
Then I'll use the binding dot button back dot set on click listener new view on click listener.

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,730
And here I need to direct the user from this activity to the main activity.

34
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,690
Okay.

35
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,030
Save the project.

36
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,360
And I want to make one last thing.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,350
Here in the main activity, when the user finishes the quiz, I need to direct the user to the results

38
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,020
activity.

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,570
So I'll check the title or the name of the button if it is equal to the finish.

40
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,630
If binding dot button next dot get text.

41
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:36,440
If it is equal to finish then I need to direct the user to the results activity.

42
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,120
It's very simple.

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
Let's run our application.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,210
This is question number one.

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,500
Next what is the result of nine times nine I select 83.

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,150
Click finish and you are directed to the results activity.

47
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,550
Your score is one over two.

48
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,560
This is the correct answer.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,290
And this is the total questions variable.

50
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,230
Back to quiz and you are directed again to the quiz.

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,660
Congratulations guys.

52
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,210
We finished this amazing application.

53
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:17,829
We reviewed the retrofit mVVM architecture and we introduced a new concept which is the MySQL databases

54
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,720
and phpMyAdmin.
