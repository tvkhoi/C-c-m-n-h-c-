00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,340
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,960
We're going to use this API that we created before in order to get the data from database into Json

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,470
format.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:16,520
So copy this PHP file, make sure that it is of extension PHP file.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,750
Go to see.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,320
Damp HD docs and create a new folder.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,860
I'll name it as quiz, and inside this quiz folder I'll place my quiz API dot php file.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,360
Make sure exam docs, quiz and my quiz API dot php.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,020
Now turn on exam.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,070
Click start start and then open Chrome.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,550
Go to localhost.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,290
And this is our dashboard.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,330
And I'll remove this dashboard here and I'll add quiz.

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,120
This is the folder.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,410
If we click enter we can see that this folder contains my quiz API dot php file.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,290
If I click on it or add the extension.

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,560
My quiz API dot php.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,900
PHP file click enter.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,400
Then we have this error.

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,290
Don't worry, I'll show you how to solve the problems step by step.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,340
Here we have uncaught Mysqli SQL exception.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,880
No connection could be made because the target machine actively refuse it.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,060
Since we didn't specify the port name.

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,070
Here we have port 4306.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:40,550
I open the php file with notepad and here I need to specify the port name.

26
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:47,750
So whenever you encounter such an error, you need to specify the port name here 4306.

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,880
Make sure to save okay Ctrl S, then refresh and the error is changed to another error.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,040
So the first error is solved.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,990
There is another error table.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,310
My quiz db dot math quiz doesn't exist.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,280
Let me see here in the line six.

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,740
So in the select statement.

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,070
So go to the select Statement and Math underscore quiz.

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,310
Let's go to the database my quiz DB.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,880
And here the table is called math underscore table and not math underscore quiz.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,230
So here I need to change it to math underscore table.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,170
Save it ctrl s then refresh.

38
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,340
And here we go.

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,900
There is another error undefined variable question array.

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,060
Maybe I missed something here in the question array on line 41.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,340
Let me go to line 41.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,580
And questions array okay.

43
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,160
You see I missed letter S Ctrl S to save then refresh.

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,270
And here we go.

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,550
This is our Json response.

46
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,070
You can see it starts with an array.

47
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,060
And then this is our first object question.

48
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,840
Option one.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,770
Option two.

50
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,850
Option three option four and correct option.

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,390
Congratulations guys.

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,880
We fetch it the database data into Json response.

53
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,920
Again let's go to here and I'll add another row.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,950
So I'll select math Table Insert.

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,920
And here I'll add the question.

56
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,400
And the correct answer is 81.

57
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,160
Click Go Browse and you can see this is the second question.

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,020
Then let's go back to here refresh.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,790
And you can see it's a second Json object added here.

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,380
This is the first question.

61
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,890
You can see the comma and the second question.
