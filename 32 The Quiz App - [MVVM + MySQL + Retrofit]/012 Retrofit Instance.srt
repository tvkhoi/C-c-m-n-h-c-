1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,680
Till now.

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,840
We created the data classes and the API service interface.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,170
Now let's move to the last part of retrofit, which is the retrofit instance.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,730
Inside the retrofit package I'll create a new Java class.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,830
I'll name it as retrofit instance.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,730
And this class intended to create a retrofit instance with a specific base URL and Json converter factory.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,330
It's a common practice to create a separate class like this, to encapsulate the configuration and creation

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,240
of retrofit instances in Android applications.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:44,950
I'll start by creating the string your base URL equals to http, and here I need to specify the IP here

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,290
in our application the API.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,490
If I look closer, we can see it's 127.0.00.1 slash quiz.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,070
This is the base URL and this is the end .127.0.0.1.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,650
It's similar to the local host.

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,099
This is the local host.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,190
Later on I'll keep this 127.0.00.1 slash quiz.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,580
Please pay attention to the link because it's case sensitive.

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:23,500
I need to create a method that it is used to create and return a configured retrofit instance.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,480
I'll start with public.

19
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,800
It's returning type is a retrofit and it's named as get retrofit instance.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,500
Inside this method you use retrofit dot builder method to construct a new retrofit instance.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,540
So I'll return because I'm going to create and return.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,470
So return new I'm creating a new retrofit dot builder.

23
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:00,970
I'm constructing a new retrofit instance dot base URL here.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,070
This method sets the base URL for the retrofit instance.

25
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:14,350
All relative URLs in your API service interface will be resolved relative to this base URL, and the

26
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,080
base URL in our application is 127.0.0.1.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Slash quiz or localhost slash quiz.

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,380
This is our base URL dot add converter factory.

29
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,820
I'll use json converter factory dot create.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,140
Here I am configuring the Json converter factory.

31
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:46,680
It tells retrofit to use the Json library to handle the serialization and deserialization of Json data.

32
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,520
Json is a popular library for working with Json in Java Android, and it's widely used with retrofit

33
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,800
to parse Json responses.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,620
Then I need to finish this instance by calling the build method.

35
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,140
This method call finalizes the creation of the retrofit instance.

36
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,640
So this is how we create an instance of the retrofit.

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,800
And we're going to use this method to get a retrofit instance in the next videos.
