00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,090
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,260
In this video we're going to set up our local development environment.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,350
We'll start by downloading Examp install it then creating our MySQL database.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,480
Go to Apache friends.org website and select download.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,660
Then select the installer according to your operating system.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,370
I'll select this exam for windows.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
Then run the installer.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:35,810
Then open the Examp and Examp is a popular free and open source software stack that facilitates the

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,260
setup and management of a local development environment for web applications.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,920
You can install similar softwares like Wamp and other softwares, but I like dealing with Examp.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,850
Examp is mainly used for developing and testing web applications in your local computer before deploying

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,170
them to a live web server, and what we are interested in is Apache and MySQL.

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,260
Click start and then go to Chrome and type 127.0.0.1.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,770
Or you can type localhost and click enter.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,010
And here is the Examp dashboard.

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,970
And from this dashboard I will select phpMyAdmin.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:29,300
phpMyAdmin is a popular open source, web based graphical user interface tool used for managing and

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,590
administering MySQL and MariaDB databases.

19
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,330
It allows users to interact with their databases through a web browser, making it easier to perform

20
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,170
various database related tasks without having to use the command line interface.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,150
phpMyAdmin provides a user friendly interface for creating, modifying, and deleting databases, tables,

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,490
and fields within those tables, and for that I use this phpMyAdmin.

23
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:10,940
I'll create a new database and the new database will be named as my quiz DB.

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,780
Click on create and here is our database.

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,370
How many tables?

26
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,540
I'll start with the first table math underscore table number of columns seven.

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,300
And here we need to specify the columns of the table and their types.

28
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,950
The first column is id its type is integer.

29
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,430
And here I'll select I which is autoincrement and it's of type primary.

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,090
Because this will act as a primary key for our table.

31
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,290
Then the second one is the question.

32
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,770
It's of type string which is a varchar.

33
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,810
And I don't need to specify here anything.

34
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,460
Option one which is of type varchar.

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,230
The fourth column is option two which is of type varchar.

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:14,560
The fifth one is option three which is of type varchar option for Varchar, and the last one is the

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,190
correct underscore option varchar.

38
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,410
Then select save.

39
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:29,710
I need to specify a valid length, and here I need to specify 50 for the ID 200 for the question, 200

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,540
for the option one and the other options and the correct option click save.

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,740
And here we go.

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,840
This is our database.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Congratulations guys.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,780
We installed Examp.

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,560
We created the database in phpMyAdmin.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,590
And we're ready to fetch the data from this database into our Android application.
