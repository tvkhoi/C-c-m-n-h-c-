Hello my friends, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,890
In this section we're going to build this gorgeous app called the Quiz App.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,440
This amazing app will fetch the data from a local database that we're going to build together.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,040
And inside this database we'll create math table.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,440
And inside this table we have records.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,470
And the records are representing questions.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,610
These questions will be fetched into Json response.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:33,290
So we're going to transform our database data and records into Json response with the help of the API

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,400
that will create.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,920
So we're going to create our own API in PHP language.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,930
And don't worry I'll show you step by step how to create this API that transforms the database records

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,660
and the questions into Json response.

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,750
Then we're going to use our old friend retrofit to transform this Json response into Pojo.

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,060
Plain old Java objects to be displayed into the app UI.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,440
This app will teach you how to create your local database.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,190
MySQL.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,970
How to create your own API, how to fetch the Json response from database, how to use retrofit to create

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,750
Java objects and display questions into Android app.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:25,120
Of course I'm going to follow mVVM architecture Model view ViewModel in this app.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,010
Moreover, I'll use data binding library.

21
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:35,330
So this is an amazing app and beautiful app that allows the user to select one choice.

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,510
So for example 35 question number two.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,280
So we'll be directing the user to the results activity and displaying the scores one over two or the

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,360
total questions.
