1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,860
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,830
We succeeded in getting and displaying the first question.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,880
Now we need to display the other questions and the next questions when the user clicks on the next button.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,980
By the way, where is the next button?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,730
This is a layout issue.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,580
I need to configure this text view and make the layout margin to 100.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,390
Run it again and you can see the next button appears.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,730
I need to add some margins here to that.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,670
The to this text view.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,350
And I'll add eight margin left and margin right eight run.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,340
And here we go.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,340
Now let's move to the main activity and create a new method called display.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:51,200
All or next questions here I need to trigger this function when the user clicks on the next button.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:00,020
So binding dot next button next dot set on click listener new view on click listener use display next

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,940
question inside this display.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,200
Next question here I'll direct check the user if he finishes the questions and the quiz.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,570
So I'm going to direct him to the results activity I'll configure this later on.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,160
Now let's focus on displaying the question and getting the correct option.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,280
I need to use a selected option integer value to check the selected option.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,610
If it is not equal to minus one and it's not null.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,030
Okay.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:38,990
Binding dot radio group dot get checked radio button ID here I'm getting from the four radio buttons

23
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,480
the ID of the selected option.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:50,060
I'm checking if this selected option doesn't equal minus one, so the user makes a selection radio button.

25
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:57,560
Radio button equals to find the view by ID, because I'm going to use this to detect the selected option

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm casting it to this selected option.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,320
Now if there is a next question then we need to do an if condition.

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:16,220
So if question list dot size minus I which is the the current question greater than zero.

29
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,540
What we need to do.

30
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:24,380
We need to get the total number of questions and check if the chosen option is correct.

31
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,740
Here I need to start with the getting number of questions.

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,030
So total questions equal to questions list dot size method.

33
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,230
This is very simple.

34
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,550
I use an array list question list and getting the size of it.

35
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,750
Then I'm getting to check if the chosen option is correct.

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,960
If radio button dot get text dot to string equals to.

37
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:56,630
Here I'm checking questions list dot get at index I dot get correct option if it is correct.

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:06,500
If the user chooses the correct option, I need to increase the result variable by one and set the text

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:16,520
this text to correct to correct answer binding dot text question or text result dot set text to correct

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:25,190
answer and the correct answers okay, this is if the chosen option is correct, so the user selects

41
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,690
the correct answer.

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,090
If I equals to zero, then I plus plus.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,480
If it is the first question, increase I by one.

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,290
Now I need to display the next question.

45
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:50,720
So binding dot text question dot set text to question number I get the number by I plus one.

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,920
And here I need to use the question list dot get I not zero.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,150
If we go back to the display first question we did it by getting the first index which is zero.

48
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,130
Here I'm getting the index I.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,350
So I refers to the question index dot get question.

50
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,350
Then I need to update the radio buttons, the four radio buttons and display the four options.

51
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:30,200
So radio one dot set text to questions list dot get I dot get option one and also similar to the next

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,050
options.

53
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,370
And I want from you to focus with me and think like me.

54
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:46,990
We need to check if it is the last question, so we need to change that button from next to finish.

55
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:55,090
So if I which refers to the question index question list dot size and comparing it with the size of

56
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,670
the array list that contains the questions.

57
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:05,740
So if the index of the question equals to the question list dot size minus one, this is the last question

58
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,730
in the array list.

59
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm going to use binding dot button.

60
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,290
Next dot set text.

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,550
To finish.

62
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,260
Here I'm changing the button title from next to finish.

63
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,170
Then I'm going to use binding dot radio group dot clear check.

64
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,380
Because I'm going to move to another question.

65
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,250
I need to clear the selection of the previous one and increase the I index, which is the question index

66
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,060
by one.

67
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,850
This is in the if close.

68
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,060
This is the if selected option is not null.

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,630
Else we need to check or display a toast message telling the user to make a selection.

70
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:53,560
So if the user didn't select any option and it clicks on the next button, I need to display a toast

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,700
message telling him that you need to make a selection.

72
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,360
Here.

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,590
I need to check also and use else condition.

74
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,830
And here this else is for this.

75
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,720
More questions to display.

76
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,380
I scroll down and remove this else and paste it here.

77
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:24,070
Then if radio button dot get text dot to string equals to question list dot get I minus one dot get

78
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,720
correct option.

79
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:35,230
Then we need to display the text text result dot set text to correct answer and we display the result

80
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,860
variable.

81
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,160
Also, I need to increase result by one.

82
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,310
Let's run and test our next button.

83
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,990
This is question number one.

84
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,790
Select 30 next.

85
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,100
So the correct answer is one.

86
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,250
Question number two what is the result of nine times nine.

87
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,780
And congratulation.

88
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,910
This is the second question.

89
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,230
So we are fetching all the questions here.

90
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,700
What is the result of nine times nine for example 80 to finish.

91
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,020
You can see finish is displayed and not next.

92
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,780
In the next videos we're going to direct the user to the results activity.
