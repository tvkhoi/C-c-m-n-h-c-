00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:08,970
We succeeded in getting the API key from the Tmdb website, and we learned about Http requests and responses.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:16,309
We succeeded in getting the response of latest movies and popular movies as Json format.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:24,720
Now let's dive into the Json syntax and learn about this amazing lightweight data interchange format.

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,220
So what is Jason?

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:36,380
Jason JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for both humans

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,840
and machines to read and write.

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,410
Jason.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,960
Data consists of a collection of key value pairs and is often used to represent structured data.

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,510
Here are the primary elements of Jason.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,790
The first element is the array.

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:00,020
Array in Jason is an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:09,080
Arrays can contain values of any type, including strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans,

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,980
and null.

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,960
The second element is objects.

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:21,040
An object in Jason is an unordered collection of key value pairs enclosed in curly braces.

16
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,460
Each key is a string, and the keys are unique within an object.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,940
Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, null, or any other Json object.

18
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,220
The third element is the key.

19
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,660
A Json object contains a key that is just a string.

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,230
Pairs of key value make up a Json object.

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:52,910
Each key is a string that represents the name of the data item, and the value can be of any Json data

22
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,500
type.

23
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,850
Key value pairs are separated by colons.

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,820
The value.

25
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,330
Each key has a value that could be a string, integer, or double, and any other data type in Json.

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,560
Let's deep dive into these elements.

27
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,850
Let's start with the keys.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,730
As mentioned before, in Json, keys must be strings written with double quotes.

29
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:25,070
For example, this name is included in double quotes and of type string, so the name represents a key

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,390
Json value.

31
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,290
Values must be one of the following data types a string a number, an object, an array a boolean or

32
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,670
null in Json.

33
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,700
String values must be written with double quotes.

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,910
For example, he'll Json objects.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,100
Json object literals are surrounded by curly braces.

36
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,210
Json object literals contains key value pairs.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,720
Key and value are separated by a colon.

38
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,650
Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid Json data type, string, number, object, array,

39
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,580
boolean and null.

40
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,120
Each key value pair is separated by a comma.

41
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,590
You can see this comma, so each key value pair is separated by a comma.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,150
Json arrays.

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,670
Arrays in Json are almost the same as arrays in JavaScript.

44
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:26,060
In Json, array values must be of type string, number, object, array, boolean, or null.

45
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,410
In a Json file, square bracket represents a Json array.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,910
So in this video we learned about the Json syntax and we learned about the elements, the arrays, objects,

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,350
key value, and values.

48
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,060
In the next video, we'll learn how to prettify the response, how to read the response from the website,

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,350
from the HTML into objects, or plain Json format file formats in order to read them.
