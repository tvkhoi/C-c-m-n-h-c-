00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,950
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's start creating our modal classes.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,760
Open Android Studio and create a new project named as the Quiz App.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,180
Then inside this package I'll create a new package named as modal.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,400
And inside this modal I'll create the modal classes for our application.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:27,560
I'll close all of these classes and in order to create the modal classes, you should refer to the Json

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,730
response here.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,400
If we look closer we have an array.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,920
And these objects the first object separated by comma and the second object.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,350
I'll copy this whole response and I'll use an online tool called Json to Pojo.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,650
Then I need to choose the package name here.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,490
The package is Campmaster coding.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,050
Dot the quiz app and paste it here and the class name.

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,170
I'll name it as question, then select Json.

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,640
Select Json because I'm going to use this Json converter.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,850
And here I'll click on preview.

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,950
And this is our class.

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,940
Copy it.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,500
And I'm going to create a new Java class.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll name it as question and I'll paste the whole response.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,420
I'll copy this copy to clipboard.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,110
Then I'll paste this.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,670
Okay.

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,260
Remove this.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,500
And we need to add the dependency.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,620
So let's go to the Gradle build.gradle.

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,490
And let's add the dependencies for retrofit and the libraries that we'll use in this application.

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:53,490
Since I'm going to use mVVM architecture I need to add the lifecycle ViewModel and LiveData dependencies.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:02,100
So for that go to Developer.android.com slash jetpack slash Android slash releases slash lifecycle.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,040
Then you scroll down to get the dependencies.

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,810
Select Kotlin and here I'll copy this lifecycle version.

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,350
Paste it here and I need to use the ViewModel.

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,670
This is the ViewModel.

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,700
And I need to use the live data.

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,560
So copy live data.

36
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,660
And if you notice there is x, you can remove it because this is for Kotlin.

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,660
Later on when we move to the Kotlin section, we'll use the dash.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:45,160
Or you can simply scroll down to select Java here the Java codes and select the view model and the live

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,640
data.

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,300
So I'll copy them and val lifecycle okay.

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,880
This is for Java because we're working with Java.

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,870
The second library that we're going to use is the retrofit.

43
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,890
This is our friend.

44
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,040
So go to square dot Github.io slash retrofit and click on download.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,520
And here I need to get this dependency copy.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,490
And here I'll use retrofit.

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Then I need to get the latest version.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,230
To get it I'll go to view GitHub project and select down to 92.9.0.

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,850
Here I'll put it like this.

50
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,330
And don't miss to add and change this dependency into this syntax.

51
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,920
I need a converter.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,650
So back to our retrofit.

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,980
I'll go up and I'll use Json copy it implementation retrofit converter Json and 2.9.0.

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:49,630
Make sure that you get the same version for the converter and the retrofit 2.9.0 sink.

55
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,560
Now later on we'll talk about these retrofit converters.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,820
Close it and you can see the problems are solved.

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,810
We created question option one, option two, option three, option four and correct option variables.

58
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:15,010
These six strings represent our modal class, our data that is fetched from the database into our application.

59
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,130
I'll remove this and annotation here.

60
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:24,700
I'll add dot modal class okay in order to solve because I'm going to place it or I place it.

61
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,860
The question inside the modal.
