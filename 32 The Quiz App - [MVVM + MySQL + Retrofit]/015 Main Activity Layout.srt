00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,190
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,270
We've done with the remote data source repository and the view model.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,630
Now let's move to the view part.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,140
In this part we're going to design our activity layouts and display the data into UI components.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,270
I'll start with the main activity.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,350
So go to the layout activity underscore main.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,870
And I'll go to the split mode.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,660
And I'll start designing my layout.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,980
In this example.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,620
And in this app I'll use data binding.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,280
So for that I need to enable it in the Build.gradle.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:44,840
And here in the Android scope I need to add build features and enable data binding sync.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,050
Now then move to the activity underscore main.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,410
And here I'll start adding the layout tag.

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,280
So layout move this layout tag.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,310
And this is good.

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,160
Now I'll move these namespaces and add them here to the layout.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,960
And as a part of our layout I'll create inside the drawable and new drawable resource file.

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,980
This will act as a background for our layout.

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,880
So I'll name it as gradient underscore back.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,670
And we talked about this drawable shapes I transform it into the shape.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,220
And here I need to specify the Android shape attribute as rectangular.

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,970
Then I need to add the gradient.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,670
This is my color gradient color and I'll use the corner.

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,980
I talked about these shapes in the previous video, so please go back to the Drawables lesson to learn

26
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,520
more.

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:11,890
I'll use this background here, so I'll specify a background attribute to add a drawable gradient back.

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,780
And this is good.

29
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,200
Now let's start designing our views.

30
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,080
I'll change this Hello World to a title, so I'll make it as Quiz app.

31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:32,500
I'll give it an ID text view to margin 200 dpi, size 72 SP and I remove button to button.

32
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,840
Okay, so this is our quiz app style would be bold.

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
And the text color.

34
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,670
This color okay this is our first text view.

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,520
The second view is a text view.

36
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,330
So.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,760
Since our app is a multiple choice, I'll use a radio group.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,330
So again, guys, if you have any doubt, please refer to the previous sections to learn about the radio

39
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,040
group and radio buttons.

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:38,500
Inside this radio group, I'll include four radio buttons, allowing the user to only choose one correct

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,430
answer.

42
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,860
Then outside this radio group and under it I'll create another view of type button wrap content.

43
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,820
Wrap content.

44
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,149
Its ID is btn button.

45
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,079
Next.

46
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,870
And the last widget is the text view.

47
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,810
And here we go.

48
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,380
This is our layout.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,880
Congratulations, guys.

50
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,430
Also, you can get the layout XML files in the resources folder under this section.

51
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,930
So if you want to skip the layout just copy and paste it.

52
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,990
You can do it by getting the resource folder.
