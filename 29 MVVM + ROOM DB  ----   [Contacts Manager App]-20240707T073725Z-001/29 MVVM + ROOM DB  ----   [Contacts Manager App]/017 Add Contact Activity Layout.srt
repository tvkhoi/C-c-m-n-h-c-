00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,010
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,630
In this video, we'll design the Add new contact activity.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:14,570
But before we move to this new activity, I should add a contact array list, dot clear code, because

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:23,300
every time without this line, every time I run the application or add the new contacts, there is a

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
duplication of items.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:33,830
So if my database contains five items, if I add one there should be six items.

7
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:43,040
But without this code, without clearing the array list, the array list will add five plus five plus

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,700
one.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,940
So it will display 11 items.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,280
This is a very important concept.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,360
I should mention it.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:58,730
You need to clear the array list that it is created as a local variable and should be cleared every

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,100
time the data change.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,120
Now let's move to add a new contact activity and open the XML file.

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,300
Here I'll create two edit texts, one for the email and one for the name and one button.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,580
Just to submit the additions.

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,670
I'll move this layout tag to here and this constraint layout would be included.

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,860
Also, the namespaces are moved and here we go.

19
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,760
This is our constraint layout.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,390
I'll add to edit text and one button.

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,780
Infer the constraints and drag and drop it to here.

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,930
Then I'll add another edit text wrap or matchparent.

23
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,190
Drag and drop it to here and infer the constraints.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,250
Then I'll add another widget, which is a button.

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,540
And the drag and drop it there to here and infer the constraints.

26
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,820
And this is our layout for add new contact activity.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,460
Then I need to add a background for this layout.

28
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:31,210
I'll copy this background image and add it to the resource folder drawable folder.

29
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,530
The constraint background equal to drawable.

30
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,860
Also, I need to change the colors for these edit tags.

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,570
Copy these attributes and paste it here in the edit text.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,910
As mentioned before, we need to use the data binding in our layouts.

33
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:04,440
So here I'll create data variables one for the handler for the click event and one as a contact variable.

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,130
Here.

35
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,160
I'll start with data variable contact.

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:17,500
It's of type Campmaster, master coding dot contacts object and the other variable named as click handler.
