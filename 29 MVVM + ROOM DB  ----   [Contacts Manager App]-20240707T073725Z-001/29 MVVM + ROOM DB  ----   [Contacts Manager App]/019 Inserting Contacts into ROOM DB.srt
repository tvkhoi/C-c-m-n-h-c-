00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,120
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:07,190
Instead of sending the name and the email to the main activity and the main activity will create a contact

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:14,840
and send it to the database we're going to use the ViewModel instance passed from the Add new contact

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,470
activity to the Add new contact Click handler and use it to insert it into our database.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:29,360
So there is no need to put extra because this method using the intents and put extra will cause some

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,840
errors when calling the main activity and sending it and the main activity will insert the database.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,920
I'll commend this and I'll show you a better approach.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,490
I'll create a new ViewModel instance in the add new contact activity before the handler.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:56,600
My ViewModel, my ViewModel equals new ViewModel provider and I'll pass this as the owner dot get and

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,670
here I need to get my ViewModel class here.

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,090
I'm getting an instance of the ViewModel here.

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,550
I'll pass it my view mode.

13
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,380
Let's go to the constructor of this add new contact handler and I'll create my ViewModel, my ViewModel.

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,670
Why I'm doing this?

15
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,120
Why I can't create my ViewModel directly here.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,410
My ViewModel equal to new my ViewModel provider.

17
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:31,070
And here you can't pass this because you need an activity or fragment.

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,830
And this class is not extending from the appcompat or any activity.

19
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,760
So for that you need to pass the ViewModel in the constructor and then use it here.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,480
You understand?

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,930
Guys, I want from you to focus with me in this idea.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,250
I'm changing the constructor and creating my ViewModel instance just to solve this error.

23
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,640
Because when you create a My ViewModel, you need to pass inside the ViewModel provider as a ViewModel

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,460
store owner and this is passed from an activity or fragment exclusively.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,680
So for that I remove this line and here I'll change the constructor.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,230
My ViewModel, this dot, my ViewModel equal to my ViewModel.

27
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,670
Now my ViewModel is passed from add new contact activity.

28
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:31,260
I'll use this ViewModel in order to insert this information about the name and email of the contact

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,900
and create a new contact object.

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:42,930
I'll name it, see new contacts and I'll set contact dot get name and contact dot get email.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:52,500
I need to insert this contact using ViewModel, my ViewModel dot add new contact and I'll pass.

32
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,030
See again guys.

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:02,850
When dealing with viewmodels, please pay attention to create an instance from it and pass it to the

34
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,510
classes that acts as click handlers here.

35
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:15,060
This class is not extending from appcompat activity, so this class is a normal class, not an activity.

36
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,380
This is an activity.

37
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,110
So inside the activity I can use ViewModel and create instances from ViewModel.

38
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:31,740
Let me run go to this activity and I'll name it as Richard Richard at Gmail, Click add contact to the

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,360
database and here we go.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,420
We are directed to the main activity and Richard contact is added to our database.

41
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,950
Congratulations, guys.

42
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:50,100
We succeeded in inserting data into our database using an instance of my ViewModel passed to the constructor

43
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,380
of the Click Handler class.
