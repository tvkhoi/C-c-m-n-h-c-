00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:08,270
Data binding util dot inflate method is provided by the Android's data binding library Android X data

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,950
binding for inflating a layout and creating a binding object.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,200
And inside this inflate method I need to pass four parameters.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,820
The first one is layout inflator dot from parent dot get context.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,230
It creates an instance of layout inflator associated with the context of the parent view group.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,390
The layout inflator is used to inflate XML layouts into view objects.

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,870
Again, if you have any doubt or you need more information about layout inflator, please refer to the

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,280
recycler view section.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,360
Then I need to pass the layout, the custom layout that I need to display as items of the recycler view.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,380
So r dot layout dot contact list item.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,890
This is the resource ID of the layout XML file you want to inflate.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,709
The third parameter is the parent.

13
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,580
This parameter specifies the parent view group to which the inflated layout should be attached.

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,840
The inflated layout becomes a child of the parent view group.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,790
The last parameter is a boolean fold and this case is false.

16
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,450
This parameter indicates whether to attach the inflated layout to the parent view group immediately

17
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,860
when set it to false.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,510
The inflated layout is not attached to the parent at this point.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,710
This is often the case when inflating layouts for recycler view items because recycler view manages

20
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,020
the attachment when necessary.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:52,350
Then I need to return a new contact Viewholder contact list item binding passed as parameter returning

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,550
a Viewholder and passing the item binding as parameter.

23
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,660
The second method is on bind Viewholder on bind Viewholder method is called by the recycler view when

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,259
it needs to display or update an item at a specific position in the list or grid.

25
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:18,270
It's called for each visible item as you scroll through the recycler view and is responsible for updating

26
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:26,790
the items view within the data for that position, the parameters are to one of type contact Viewholder.

27
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,560
And this parameter is the Viewholder object for the item at the specified position, it holds references

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,290
to the views within the items layout.

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,830
The second parameter is of type integer.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,150
This parameter indicates the position of the item in the recycler view's data source.

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,940
For example, an array list or data source cursor.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,010
And in this case it's an array list.

33
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:58,230
So inside the on bind viewholder you use the holder parameter to access the views within the items layout.

34
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,870
For example, in our case we have two text views.

35
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:11,430
So I specify holder dot name or email, but since I'm using data binding so I need to use this contact

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,690
list item binding object to get the references and need to display or update an item at a specified

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,260
position.

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,470
For that, I'll make a contact object.

39
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,910
Current contact dot get index at position here.

40
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm getting the current contact, then I'll use holder dot contact dot set contact to current contact

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,860
again on bind.

42
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,250
Viewholder is used to display or update an item at a specific position in the list.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,060
This method determines the total number of items in the data set that will be displayed in the recycler

44
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,450
view.

45
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,230
So this method is used to specify the total number of items that the recycler view should display.

46
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:06,560
And in our case, I need to get the size of the contacts list that we created and here I need to check

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:16,040
if contacts array list doesn't equal to null, then go and return contacts dot size, otherwise it will

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
return zero.

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:24,620
So this is how we create the adapter and how we link the recycler view with data bind.

50
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,830
And one last thing I need to mention and add is the notify data set changed here.

51
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,430
I need to use public void set contacts.

52
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,330
This is the setter of this array list.

53
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:45,380
Or you can simply add like this alt+ insert setter and this contacts array list.

54
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:53,210
Under this I'll use notify data set changed method notify data set.

55
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,120
Changed method is a method provided by recycler view adapter class to inform the.

56
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,310
That recycler view that the underlying data set has changed and the recycler view should refresh its

57
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,990
views to reflect these changes.

58
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:16,390
It tells the recycler view that the data has changed and that it should rebind the views, possibly

59
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,360
creating new views and updating existing ones.

60
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,680
You typically call notify data set changed method after making changes to the data source that the recycler

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,000
view is displaying.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,040
So this is our adapter class that extends from recycler view and we learned about how to use data binding

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,480
with the recycler view.
