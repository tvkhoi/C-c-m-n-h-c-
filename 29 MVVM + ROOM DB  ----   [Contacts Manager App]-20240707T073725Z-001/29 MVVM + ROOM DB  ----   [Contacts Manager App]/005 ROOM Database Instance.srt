00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,550
The third step in creating our room database is to create the database class.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,990
The database class is an abstract class that serves as the database holder.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,240
It includes methods to access the daos and create a database instance.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,980
Let's create this database class and I'll name it as contact database.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:34,920
You annotate the database class with the Add database annotation and specify the list of entities it

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,650
includes and the database version.

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:46,170
Since our application has only one entity class one table called context table, I need to specify it

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,560
here.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,350
So entities equal to and here I need to specify it inside a list.

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,970
But since our application has only one entity table, I need to specify it here as only entity contacts

11
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,280
dot class and I'll specify the version equal to one later on.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,210
When you update your database, you need to increase this number.

13
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:17,350
I'll create it as an abstract, as mentioned before, to prevent any possible creation of this class

14
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,860
so you prevent possible creation of objects extends.

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:29,470
And here I need to tell Android studio that I need to extend from the room database so this class will

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:39,910
act as a database instance using the annotation, add database and extending room database from Android

17
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,560
X room package.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,330
So in order to understand it better, you need to create a class extending from room database.

19
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:55,480
And it's an abstract class and annotated with database and you specify the entity.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,040
So you are linking this database with the entity.

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,460
Now we need to link this database with the Dao.

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:13,180
So for that I'll create a method that returns a contact Dao Public Abstract Contact Dao object.

23
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,500
It's returning type and get contact Dao.

24
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,350
This is a method named as get contact Dao.

25
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,300
Then it's returning type is as contact Dao class.

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Here I am linking this database with Dao by using this method.
