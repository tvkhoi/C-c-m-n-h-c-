00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,080
And congratulations, guys.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,600
This is our application displaying Jack as a contact from our room database.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,590
But there is a problem if I run the application again with the ID equal to one, it will cause an error

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,490
because I'm specifying the ID and in room database.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:28,160
It's a unique identifier, so I need to remove it and go to the contacts constructor and remove the

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,510
ID from here because the room database will do this job and autogenerate new contacts with the new IDs.

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,740
Run the program and it will solve the problem again.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,730
Then I'll move to the main activity and I need to display the contacts into the recycler view.

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,800
So for that I need to refill this ArrayList.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:03,450
I need to assign this contact array list in the unchanged method Contacts array list dot add C so every

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:10,260
contact in the contacts list, go and add it to the contacts array list.

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,290
I need to move these lines.

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,460
The adapter.

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,950
Under the ViewModel.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,580
Observe Contacts.

16
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,270
Array list.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,010
Let me run the application.

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,240
And we have this null pointer exceptions.

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,730
I can resolve them by changing here the contacts list, remove it and.

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,270
Okay.

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:42,160
I need to initialize it at first, so I'll scroll and I need to initialize a new array list.

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,120
Run it again.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,310
And here we go.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,700
This is our application.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,780
It's working fine.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,440
If I search for Tag and I can see the contacts.

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:58,090
So every time I run the application, it will create a new jack with a different ID and insert it into

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,080
our database.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,250
And the most important trick here is to notify the data that recycler view with the new data.

30
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:16,540
So I'll use my adapter dot notify data set changed method inside ViewModel dot observe method.

31
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,460
This is the most important part here.

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:28,010
In order to display the data from logcat into the items of the recycler view, so notify data set.

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,060
Changed method is a method provided by recycler views adapter to notify the recycler view that are underlying

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,570
data has changed and the recycler view should refresh its views to reflect these changes.

35
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:49,310
This method is often used when you've made changes to the data resource and you need the recycler view

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,340
to display this change and you need to ensure that the UI is updated accordingly.

37
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,820
Let's stop the application and run it again.

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,280
And the Congratulations guys.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,480
We succeeded in displaying the items of the recycler view from the room database.
