1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,950
Let's continue with the view of the mvvm.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,790
And in this video I'll add the data binding variables of the layouts.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:17,150
So inside the contact list item, I'll add a new variable here of type contacts that we created.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,500
And this is the modal class or the entity class of our database.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,390
So I'll start with the data and remember you need to place it under the layout element and before any

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,240
other layout the data here I start with a variable and the name would be contact and the type come master

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,020
coding.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,410
This is the package and select the contacts class.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:50,180
Now I need to refer the contact and get the contact name and email from this variable.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:57,080
So for that I'll scroll down to here and instead of using name I'll add syntax of data binding.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,740
And here I'll set the contact dot name the same way.

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,120
I'll scroll down at contact dot email.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,520
It's very simple guys, and we talked about it in details in the data binding section.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,590
We finished this layout.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,330
Let's move to the main activity layout and I'll add a click event and handle the click events on this

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,220
fab, this floating action button.

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,580
For that, I'll create here data and I'll start with the variable.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:37,290
The name would be click handler and the type would be a new class that I will create here, create a

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,550
new Java class.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,840
I'll name it as main activity Click handlers.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,680
When using data bindings and you have many classes you can name main activity.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,490
This is referring for the main activity and the click handlers.

23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,630
This class will act as a click handler for the main activity, so all the clicks on the main activity

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,980
user interface will be captured and handled here.

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,500
I'll start with a context context.

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,520
I need to pass the context from the main activity and I'll create a constructor having the context and

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,720
I'll create a new method called on Fab.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,430
I need to pass a view.

29
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't miss to pass the view object in the data binding in order to handle all the click events on the

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,090
View.

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:38,400
And here I'll start with the intent I equal to new intent and I'll set main activity dot this or get

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,090
application context and add new contact activity dot class and context dot start activity.

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,710
I'll pass the intent.

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,920
Let's create this activity project.

35
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:02,970
New activity, empty views activity and I'll name it as add new contact activity finish and this is

36
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,590
our new activity.

37
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Then move back to the activity.

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:14,760
Underscore main dot XML and here I need to specify the type com dot master coding and here I'll specify

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,660
main activity.

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,140
Click handlers scroll down to the fab.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,680
On.

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:28,840
Click and select this method and click handlers at Click Handler, dot on Fab Click.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,790
And we talked about this operator that refers to the methods in the data binding.
