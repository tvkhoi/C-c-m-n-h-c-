00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,090
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,460
In this video, I'll mention a very important concept, which is how to get the data from edit text

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,760
and pass them to the main activity using data binding and using the intents, of course.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,730
So I want from you to focus with me.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,840
For that I'll create a new variable called Click Handler.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,160
And the type of this variable is a new class that I'll created.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,970
Now add new contact Click Handler.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:35,660
This class will handle the click events on this button and direct the user from this activity to the

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,650
main activity.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,220
Getting the name and the email from edit text.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,540
For that, I'll create a contact object in order to pass the name and the email to it and assign them.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,150
And I need a context object because I am going to use the intents.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:01,230
I'll create the constructor having these two variables and I'll create a new method called on Submit

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,040
button.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,520
Click.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Don't miss to pass a view as an object.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,160
This is for data binding.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,720
Always make sure when you are going to execute any method, you should add the view as a parameter.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:26,190
Then let's check if contact dot get name doesn't equal to or equal equal to null or contact dot get

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,320
email equal equal to null.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
I don't need to make anything.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,730
I need to display an error message telling him that fields can't be empty.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,140
Else I need to pass the data from the edit text to the main activity.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,210
So else here I need to start intent.

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:58,020
I equal to new intent and I'll use the context object that I created to get the current destination

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,770
context.

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,450
And next destination is the main activity dot class.

28
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,750
And I mentioned this in the intent section.

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,750
I need to put extra to put more information to this intent.

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,570
I equal to put extra and here I'll pass key value pairs one for the name and one for the email.

31
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,100
And the name and the email.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,970
Two variables are of type string.

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,060
The key of the name would be name and the value of it.

34
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:39,340
It's get it from the context dot get name and I dot put extra the key of the email is email and make

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,600
sure that you'll type them later on in the main activity.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,010
In the same way you type the key because you need to specify the key and it's a case sensitive to get

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,740
the value context dot get email.

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,420
Then I need to start the activity context dot start activity and I need to pass I.

39
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:08,350
Now the last step is to link the data binding with function that we created here on submit button.

40
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,910
Click and link the edit text with the contact object.

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,780
Here I'll create.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,320
Com dot master coding context manager app and here I need to specify add new contact click handler.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Then let's move down to the edit text here.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:36,400
It's very important step to specify text equals and when using two way binding, you should mention

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:46,720
this equal sign contact dot name and the second edit text is text at equals contact dot email.

46
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,760
Then let's move to the button.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:58,510
And here we should mention onClick attribute at without the equal sign handler to Collins on submit

48
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,680
button click.

49
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:08,740
The last step is to move to the Add new Contact Activity class and initialize the data binding private

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,760
activity.

51
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,079
Add the new contact binding binding, and I need to create an instance from the class that we created

52
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,519
for the click handling.

53
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,750
Object type cont.

54
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,400
Then I'll move to the Oncreate method.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:33,340
Contacts equal to new contacts equals data binding util dot setcontentview.

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,580
And here I need to specify the layout or dot layout dot add new count.

57
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,020
This refers to the context of this add new contact activity.

58
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,900
Then I need to set the contact.

59
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:56,730
I need to pass this contact object and to pass it to the binding binding dot set contact to contacts.

60
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,510
This is a very important step.

61
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,920
Many people miss this.

62
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:08,410
I need to create and initialize the handler new add, new contact handler and I need to pass two parameters.

63
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,000
The first one is the context and the context of the Add new contact activity.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,670
And the second parameter is the contacts object that we created before.

65
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,560
I need to switch between them because the first one is the context and the second is the context.

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,300
Then I need to link this handler with the data binding.

67
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,030
So set click handler to handle.

68
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:38,510
What we've done here is to create and initialize the binding the handler and to create a new object

69
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,050
called contacts and assign it to this variable.

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,960
And the click handler is passed here and assigned to this by using set click handler.

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,180
Let's run, click on this fab.

72
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,110
If I don't add anything, fields can't be empty.

73
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,610
Those messages will appear.

74
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:02,690
I'll add John john@gmail.com click add contacts to room and here we go.

75
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,500
We are directed to the main activity and having the intent extra, which is the name and the email.

76
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,430
In the next videos we're going to insert email and name that we passed here into our database.
