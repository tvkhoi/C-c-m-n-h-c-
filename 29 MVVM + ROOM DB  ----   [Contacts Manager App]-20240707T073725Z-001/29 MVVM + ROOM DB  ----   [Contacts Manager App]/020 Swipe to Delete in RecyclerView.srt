00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,240
Let's learn how to implement swipe to delete functionality to the recycler view.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:12,050
But at first I need to create card views for the items and change the background of our application.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:21,560
I'll create here inside the contact list item a card view Matchparent Wrap content and inside this card

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,520
view implement my constraint layout so I copy this and move it inside our card.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,060
View this constraint layout that contains the two text views.

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:43,070
Here I'll add elevation 20 DPI, corner radius 20 DPI and I'll add some margin margin left and right,

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,870
20 DPI and margin top five DPI margin.

8
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,370
Bottom five DPI.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,420
It's good.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,180
The cards here is the width should be zero and here zero DPI.

11
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,870
Okay.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,740
It's good.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,820
If we run the application it looks better with the card views.

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,440
I'll copy this background and paste it in the drawable folder and you can see it.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,580
It's very beautiful.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,150
Let's make it our main activity background.

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,350
And here in the constraint layout, set the background back to and it's very simple and classic application.

18
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:31,710
Let's design this fab drawable folder and the new vector asset, and here I'll name it as Ik add clip

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,010
art.

20
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:38,400
Click on this and search for Add and I'll use this sign click.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,620
Okay, you can change the color.

22
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,190
I'll set it to red next and click finish.

23
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:54,620
Then add the background tint black and source compat android src and select it baseline underscore at

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,140
24.

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,770
I remove this background and it's better.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,810
Now you can see the plus sign.

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:09,360
And let's move to start deleting items from the database when the user swipe the items in the recycler

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,480
view open main activity and here under the recycler view dot set adapter I'll implement swipe to delete

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:25,840
functional new item touch helper new item touch helper and select simple callback method and you'll

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,140
implement two methods on move and on swipe.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,140
Now let's explain itemtouchhelper.

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:40,930
New Itemtouchhelper is used to create an instance of Itemtouchhelper, which is a utility class in Android

33
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,360
that provides support for handling touch gestures, especially for swipe and drag and drop actions in

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
a recycler view or similar view.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,830
The constructor of Itemtouchhelper.

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,980
A simple callback takes two arguments.

37
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,410
The first argument is zero.

38
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,310
In this case specifies the drag and drop directions.

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,790
Zero means no drag and drop is supported.

40
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:15,310
The second argument is Itemtouchhelper dot left specifies the swipe directions.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,560
In this case it indicates the swiping items to the left is supported.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,340
So I'm going to swipe the items to the left in order to delete them and we override it.

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,330
Two methods.

44
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,300
The first one is on move.

45
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:38,650
This method is called when an item in recycler view is moved as part of a drag and drop operation.

46
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,250
And in this case I'll not use it on swipe.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,110
This method is called when a recycler view item is swiped by the user.

48
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,860
Parameters.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,630
Viewholder and direction Viewholder the viewholder of the item that was swiped and direction and integer

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,440
indicating the swipe direction left or right and inside the method you define the action to be taken

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
when an item is swiped.

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,940
So if you swipe the item to the left, what I need to do, I need to delete this item.

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:22,330
So contacts C equals to contacts array list dot get viewholder dot get adapter position get adapter

54
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,950
position method is a method that is provided by the Viewholder class.

55
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,930
It returns the adapter position of the item associated with the Viewholder.

56
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:39,670
The adapter position represents the item's position within the data set that the recycler view is currently

57
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,690
displaying.

58
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:49,240
It can change if the items are added, removed or rearranged in the adapters data source and get method

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,380
is typically used to retrieve data from a data source such as an array list in our case.

60
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,190
So I'm getting the swiped item.

61
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,600
Then I need to execute the method delete contact.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:14,290
I need to use view model dot delete contact and here I need to pass the contact that I get it its position.

63
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,190
Then I need to add a very important thing here.

64
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,990
Dot attach to recycler view recycler view.

65
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:30,580
This method attached to recycler view is used with Android's Itemtouchhelper class to attach it to a

66
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,480
recycler view.

67
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:39,640
It associates the itemtouchhelper with the recycler view, enabling it to handle swipe and drag and

68
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,450
drop gestures for the items within the recycler view.

69
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,260
Let's run.

70
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,600
This is our great application.

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:55,390
Now let's try to swipe the recycler view and you can see I deleted Richard contact from our application.

72
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,240
Let me close all applications and then run it to test our database.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,120
And you can see Jack and James are still Richard is deleted.

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,680
Congratulations, guys.

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,510
We succeeded in adding the delete functionality to our app.

76
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,470
Location using swipe to delete.
